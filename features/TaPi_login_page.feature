  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    When I enter "testanya108+amn@gmail.com" in the email field
    And I enter "12345" in the password field
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the devices page

   Then I should remain on the login page
   And I should see error message "Sorry, unrecognized username or password"
